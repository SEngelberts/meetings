Notes
=====

-   Draft Community Group Report

    -   Reasons: putting together regular updates is useful

    -   Some drift in scope / priority / what problems we’re trying to
  solve right now vs. big picture seems to be happening

    -   Clairity between the two is sometimes unclear

    -   Chairs are writing this down now

    -   Clearly stating work items and initiatives of the space

    -   Draft status right now - still being worked on - comments
  welcome

    -   Is it enough? Right direction?

    -   Some points describing items of disagreement is included

    -   And also where we are focusing our discussions

-   Kris: Wrote the intro portion of it

    -   General idea: someone brand new would be able to understand
  concerns

    -   Why we are working on FedID vs. Privacy changes and implications
  of those

    -   Basic intro – how does it all work

    -   And some intro to some proposals, but generally straightforward

    -   Make it obvious that we’re discussing with all major players

    -   After intro / overview of FedID, use cases are next and related
  proposals

    -   Everyone should have access to the link

    -   Feel free to edit as necessary or sends comments / suggestions
  to Kris

-   Heather: Currently it is a Google Doc

    -   But intention is to convert to Markdown doc and put it into the
  GitHub repo

    -   When should we convert to Markdown?

-   BrianM: NOt until we have general consensus

-   Vittorio: Collab on Google Docs is a lot easier than doc

-   BrianM: Also - people feel much more empowered to make free changes
  on Google Docs

-   Sam: Also same – GitHub requires PRs which is often too high a bar
  than just leaving comments on Google Doc

-   BrianM: Also helps others see what has happened to the doc

-   Achim: Also tools to easily convert from Google Doc to Markdown
  easily

-   Tim: Also could use Hackmd tool to convert to Markdown

-   Sam: Is this an official report and who will be reading it? And what
  timelines do you have in mind?

-   Kris: Wrote it so that anyone who might be interested could come in
  – will be published as part of FedID CG

    -   Want to generally inform what we are working on

    -   Focus currently is on cookie changes

    -   Should inform people who might be thinking of joining would be
  able to easily discover scope

-   Heather: W3C hasn’t asked for this - more of a response of people
  asking for an outline of scope of project and help getting other
  members of Identity community to engage (Banking, Healthcare,
  etc.)

-   Kris: Terminology: Just put in the list of key terms - no
  definitions yet.

    -   Mostly terms that are used in Intro section

    -   Should focus on creating these definitions - will help with
  common understanding of meaning of key terms among FedIDCG
  members

-   BrianM: This should be of general interest for anyone interested in
  getting up to speed.

    -   Maybe also put it up on GitHub as a standalone doc?

-   Heather: It will be published on Community Group website

    -   I will be creating a link from the FedIDCG page to point to the
  report

    -   Also: Some people have asked when we’re done with a particular
  use-case

    -   Wanted to cover that in this report

        -   Identity and describe each use case and when it is done

    -   These are the use cases that have been driving work to date

-   Tim: So far, 5 there. Other 2 are Sign-Out and Token Renewal to be
  added

-   Heather: We have these that Tim has added:

    -   Embedded party with resources

    -   Sign-In

-   Tim: Any additional?

-   Kris: Session Management

-   Tim: That is part of Token Renewal

-   Vittorio: Why are the specific Use Cases in the report? As opposed
  to separate doc?

-   Heather: Wanted to provide outline and point to Github issues?

-   Vittorio: Is there a complete description anywhere?

-   Tim: Trying to summarize here and then point to GiHub issues

-   Vittorio: Arre the GitHub issues the complete scenario and
  description?

-   Tim: There are multiple issues talking about Relying Party identity

-   Vittorio: So, these are categories of use cases, which can then
  point to specific use-cases in GitHub?

-   Sam: I can volunteer to be a good reviewer or even author as
  required

-   Heather: Hopefully the first iteration can be published in the next
  Month or so

    -   Not set in stone – will evolve over time

    -   Hopefully before TPAC in the Fall we will have another iteration

-   GeorgeF: Does IDP Federation include the chaining types of flows?

    -   If cookies are removed, there are a number of chained type of
  protocols

    -   Hit Gateway – that says you need to do OIDC with IDP

    -   IDP says, in turn, You need to do this SAML thing with the
  back-end

    -   How do we cover those types of specific sub-categories

-   Tim: That would certainly be under here – is there a specific issue
  that would capture?

-   Achim: We filed this type of issue a couple of weeks ago

-   George: So we will link the specific sub-issues with these top level
  categories?

-   Tim: Do people agree with these top level categories?

-   Can we put notes at the top with relevant things such as target
  publication dates so that reviewers can plan?

-   

-   Heather: Shift To Session Management

-   Dan: Continuing to work on Session Extension User Story

    -   OIDC Session Management

    -   Part of confusion is that there is also OIDC Session Management
  which is a different thing

    -   So Session Extension and Session Management need to be clear
  about different

    -   Session Management

    -   Trick to determine if you are still authenticated with IDP
  without making network request

    -   Two variants

    -   One uses IDP cookie / other uses IDP local storage

    -   Both will break after 3P cookie deprecation

    -   We’re mostly concerned about the cookie version

    -   Does that sound correct?

-   George: If both are going to break when 3P cookies go away, what are
  the options for IDPs that use local storage version?

    -   Also is there a different part of things working on Front
  Channel Logout?

-   Dan: Shouldn’t have put that sentence in there (the part about Front
  Channel Logout)

    -   Might have read something in Session Management spec

    -   We definitely care about Front Channel Logout – need to send
  appropriate cookies to RPs for that

    -   But that is a different scope from this

    -   FedCM cares about Cookies – not about Local Storage (from FedCM
  hat specifically)

    -   However FedID CG will probably have to figure out the Local
  Storage version of that – Chrome decouples Cookies from the
  more general requestStorageAccess()

    -   Ok: Token Renewal:

    -   Code Flow / Hybrid flow are the same from a Cookie perspective

    -   Top level redirect is funneling this up through IDP

    -   Don’t need 3P cookies for this

    -   Back end does token refreshes for you - so up until this point,
  we don’t need to care about this from a 3P Cookie Deprecation
  perspective

-   George: As long as all redirects are top-level this fine

    -   However, there is also the iframe based

-   Dan: This is specifically token refresh in the back-end

-   George: In this case are you discussing tokne renewal as the refresh
  token grant?

-   Dan: This could also be access codes as ewel

    -   But for this specifically is when renewals happen and the
  browser is NOT involved

-   George: Fine - prob need to update picture to capture the context

-   Dan: This might kick in when we consider Link Decoration

-   George: HOwever there is still a top-level redirect going through
  the browser

    -   As soon as you throw top-level redirects, the browser IS
  involved

    -   This would be the normal login flow

    -   We would want to call out clearly taht this flow is about
  top-level redirects

    -   As token renewal in teh context of browser leverage is usually
  NOT a top-level redirect.

-   Dan: Was trying to show how this is all set up (steps 1 to 3) and
  the renewal itself is STep 4

    -   Possibly too much here?

    -   A certain amount of setup has to get the code in the first place

    -   And the back-end will be refreshing from that point on

-   George:

    -   Ok so reliable that 1 to 3 are preconditions to 4

-   Vittorio:

    -   This is one way to get into a position to use renewal on the
  back end

    -   If you do Token Exchange that we didn’t mention use-cases as
  browser is usually not involved, end result would be that

    -   So, for renewal: I got a refresh token on back-end so I don’t
  need browser anymore

-   Dan: All the code flow is : I got a token SOMEHOW and will then
  renew it

-   Dan: Implicit flow is next

    -   If not using iframe and calling directly to IDP or has an IDP
  iframe

-   Vittorio: Method of using iframe is not necessarily implicit flow

    -   Here it is getting access token directly from iframe

    -   Alternate: use iframe to get a code, prompt=none

    -   Which means either get me what i want (the code) or just throw

    -   That is also broken in the same way by absence of 3P cookies

-   Dan: So Drawings are correct, but title is not sufficient to cover
  all cases

    -   You could be refreshing access token or getting a code from IDP

    -   All in scope for 3P cookie deprecation

-   Vittorio: It is definitely a 3P cookie issue

    -   Not necessarily a FedCM issue

-   Dan: We qualify it as a FedCM issue as we need the IDP’s cookie one
  way or another

-   Dan: With Refresh token

    -   Very similar

    -   IDP has provided Refresh Token that RP can use either through
  iframe or not

    -   We think it is not impacted by 3P cookie deprecation

    -   Is that true?

    -   We are worried about using the Refresh Token - that seems like
  it would affework

    -   But getting the Refresh Token in the first place might be broken
  by 3P cookie deprecation

-   Vittorio: Might want to care about side effect

    -   That we are touching the IDP session

    -   If not using iframe not touching IDP session which might affect
  SSO

-   DAn: SSO might time out (even if 3P cookies are not involved)

    -   Might not impact the flow specifically but could impact it due
  to cookie expiry

-   George: Re: Point 2: No specific association in standard linking IDP
  to RP sessions

    -   Standard allows refresh tokens to be tied to sessions, but
  allows for other models as well

-   Dan: Any missing cases?

-   Heather: No comments so far

-   Dan: Will ask Vittorio to see if it is comprehensible?

-   Vittorio: Is this a section of something bigger?

-   Dan: Need to rewrite it to present it in the future

    -   In comments in GitHub have been refining to ensure it is correct

    -   Does this seem comprehensive to the idea of Session Extension?

    -   If so will consolidate into an official CUJ

    -   Want to make sure it is mostly correct

-   Vittorio: Don’t put on yourself burden of If it is not exhaustive it
  is not correct

    -   Instead mention arthe frequent patterns, not go for exhaustive

    -   For example Front Channel Logout is also important

-   Dan: Front Channel Logout is a separate CUJ as it is not considered
  to be part of Session Extension

-   Vittorio: sign into website, do no activity , go to another tab,
  come back to previous tab, want it to be live.

    -   Trying to get new idtoken without getting access token, so that
  sliding expiration gets triggered

    -   This is a form of renewal not covered by standard

-   Dan: VAriant of implicit flow?

-   Vittorio: Yes you get an idtoken back, but it is a trick to get app
  to renew its session without activity

-   George: Can leverage redirect

    -   Also some people will just update their session cookie without

-   Dan: As long as there is an IDP iframe that is pinging the IDP that
  gets SOMETHING (code / token / whatever) that is good enough.

-   Brock Allen: Front Channel Logout is usaed to notify the RP that
  user has logged out

    -   Useful for SPA style apps to notify the RP that IDP’s session
  has ended

-   Dan: We have been specifically untangling them because cookie usage
  is reversed

    -   From Browser’s perspective, easier to decouple them

    -   There should be a Front Channel Logout issue in the repo already

    -   Will have t

-   Brock: If this is re-titled that would help to clarify

-   Dan: Also words that we use in Browser sometimes different - so
  Chrome should change to start using community terms

-   Heather: Terminology section in docs should help a lot

-   

-   AOB items

-   Kris: I’m doing intro on FedCM for Business Group tomorrow

    -   Link will be emailed to all members of group

    -   Give any feedback

    -   Will turn into materials

    -   Idea of presentation tomorrow is to inform people that FedID CG
  work is going on
