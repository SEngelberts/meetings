Notes
=====

-   Federated Login OICD OAuth2 Auth Code Flow

    -   Kris Chapman: Goal to help anyone identify proposals and when
      they may be useful. Sometimes you will see a Purple box with
      “Third-Party Cookies”

        -   Purple means it is a viable option

        -   Red means this will not be viable after we get rid of 3rd
          party cookies

        -   Gray/”?” means I don’t know

    -   Peter: This work is very much worth while, lots of cases to
      cover

    -   Kris: also made minor tweaks to text from last week. Added
      Hybrid/implicit flow. The Flow is the same but it’s maining
      about what the RP or IDP are doing. More the details you need
      to watch. Same with SAML, sending request, returning record.

    -   Heather: That’s not today that’s future?

    -   Kris: yes SAML flow is future

    -   Achim: Does the UA think they are logged in, is this in terms of
      a future role for API access. Is this in terms of today or the
      future.

    -   Kris: I should remove that

    -   Achim: why is the box “yes/no out of scope”? Difference between
      registration sign-up sign-in

    -   Kris: I’ll note that, we can update that. And the plan is to
      have a version of these for all of those trees

    -   Heather: to distinguish between logging in and registering.

    -   Kris: and embedded 3rd party content

    -   Ben VanderSloot: And just to explain scope, I think “login”
      means logging in to 1st party login

    -   Kris: other thing is if there are questions or decisions or
      anything missing please let me know, I’ve not done this
      before, I’m sure I missed something. Created a github feedback
      issue 15
      ([<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/15</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/15))

    -   Kris: And I am trying to use the icons to describe which
      browsers support which behaviors, but if you think that’s
      confusing or should be made more explicit please let me know.

    -   Heather: Would love to ask the Chrome/Firefox/Safari team to
      also each do one of these to see how they understand the
      diagram and if it matches

    -   Heather: We agree these diagrams are certainly useful to have, I
      know we want these in time for TPAC (great to discuss with
      Privacy CG). But once it’s complete, what do we do with these?
      (Maintenance, publication, etc?) Any suggestions?

    -   Peter: Already on Github so that’s technically already
      published. As for where else, do we have our own site?

    -   Heather: we have a draft report and landing page on w3c site
      where we can make blog posts. I try to present as often as
      possible.

    -   Peter: does this show we need another protocol and who will
      define/implement it?

    -   Heather: protocol or API?

    -   Peter: I mean both, for instance CHIPS and Storage Access, for
      the purple for this it says I need this. It’s a lot of
      proprietary API’s. It can be 1 that fits all but it cannot be
      reached anyway.

    -   Ben: that’s the fork, we want to implement CHIPS and FedCM and
      we want to use that to cover different cases which results in
      the Red “?”

    -   Kris: I did note that the storage access aPI could impact UX.

    -   Heather: FedCM prompts user as well yeah? That’s how the browser
      sorts things out

    -   Kris: For Implicit, it’s the details of the boxes as to what’s
      changing and who’s doing it

    -   Peter KH: I think one useful outcome out of this exploration is
      to determine whether the loginStatusApi is needed to solve any
      use cases

    -   Heather: no, it’s there but it sets a flag nothing currently
      consumes

    -   Kris: I suspect Safari will use it to trigger things but for now
      it’s just info

    -   Achim: I understand it can be set by certain API’s but not
      addressing a step. COuld change behavior/flows but doesn’t
      solve from a scoping perspective

    -   Kris: would love for apple to participate on explaining that in
      a longer term vision

    -   Achim: FedCM move certain UI interactions into browser control
      but then puts us in to AuthCode redirect

    -   Heather: in short term, sounds like 1st party sets would cut
      down on how often FedCM needs to interrupt to get consent.

    -   Achim: but only for 1st party not 3rd party

    -   Heather: yes, 1st party is where we are concerned. So Kris at
      this point we want the following call to actions

        -   Browser People: Create browser specific flows

        -   Kris: continue developing generic flows

        -   Everyone else: identify anything we missed and add it to the
          issue

    -   Also please recommend any other tools for updating/curating

-   TPAC

    -   Heather: if you haven’t registered and plan to attend please do
      so. Kris Tim and I will be in training because we expect
      hybrid sessions. Also saw a lot of stuff come through on the
      FedCM repo, if any of the chrome folks wanna share something
      specific please let me know. Next meeting will be an asia
      pacific call for Monday August 1st

    -   Peter Geitz: can we get a link to the event?
