Notes
=====

Looking at
[<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/15\#issuecomment-1200054481</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/15#issuecomment-1200054481)

-   Vittorio: Which browsers do session binding? as far as we know, none
 of them. Chrome have dropped support for token binding. Edge might
 have something for token binding, but they are (probably) the only
 browser that does that at this point. At IETF 114 last week,
 someone from GitHub did indicate that session binding and proof of
 position would be highly desirable. Maybe DPOP keys?

-   Kris: for questions 2 and 3, we should ask the Chrome team to do
 versions of these to answer these questions for Chrome

-   Vittorio: if FedCM is a Google feature, our tree might reflect that
 (separate trees per browser).

-   Heather: in the question from Peter, I wonder why a decision tree
 for proof of possession would be useful if almost all browsers
 don’t support it? Or is this thought on future work?

-   Emily: proof of possession was an issue Microsoft raised with
 regards to FedCM as something that would be very useful last year.
 Unclear if FedCM has taken that up to implement. (See
 [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/15\#issuecomment-1200054481</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/15#issuecomment-1200054481))

-   Kris: For 4, yes, that idea was “are they trying to log into a
 federated account or not” because if not, it’s not something in
 scope. For 5, no, it’s just a decision about “are you doing
 tracking on the server or not”. It’s not about SPA. Will take
 these and clarify the text.

-   Vittorio: I read that as “is there a session or not?”

-   Kris: For question 6, do vendors offer CNAMES for customers?

-   Vittorio: Yes, Okta and Auth0 offer this service, but feedback in
 the past from Safari is that this might not be something supported
 by Safari forever. But even if you aren’t working with a white
 label service for Okta \| Auth0, expect many others do this as
 well.

-   Kris: My argument is that pushing information out of the browser to
 the server is actually worse for the user because it becomes
 entirely opaque to them at that point. But, back to question 6,
 will update text.

-   Vittorio: Suggest we say yes, we know why CNAMES might be used, but
 during the privacycg it was suggested that this might not be
 consistent across browsers in the future.

-   Kris: for question 7, what she intended in the flow was “can you use
 things like CHIPS or other browser options so that it can be
 double keyed and you can still have it partitioned”

-   Vittorio: if I remember that correctly, it’s all top-level
 redirects.

-   Kris: Need a bit more clarity on 7 through 9. For the session tree
 feedback, though, that’s a work in progress. Feedback is valid,
 but the document isn’t done yet.

-   Heather: Looking to the suggestion of “current” and “future” for how
 to indicate FedCM features, that seems like a bit of a stretch for
 future-proofing these diagrams beyond a few days. FedCM
 development is very active, and it’s in origin trials, so expect
 changes to be frequent. If there is a better way to do this,
 that’s probably going to need to be up to the FedCM team to keep
 up to date.

-   Kris: We’re looking at FedCM as to what FedCM is intended for
 launch.

-   Vittorio: would love to get their feedback on present vs future so
 we can have a clear vision of what they’re planning.

-   Kris: dates on what they’re planning in terms of features would be
 helpful too.

Joke of the week: Q: Why does everyone love volcanoes? A: Because they
are lava-ble.
