Notes
=====

-   TPAC 2022 Planning:

    -   High Level Agenda:
 [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1616EDFkRvzMEJT1xE-ZDZHAmQjRcY5TxAiANcbbJcA8/edit](https://us02st-cf.zoom.us/web_client/6orpgrb/html/externalLinkPage.html?ref=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1616EDFkRvzMEJT1xE-ZDZHAmQjRcY5TxAiANcbbJcA8/edit)

    -   Other meetings have been adjusted – previous conflict with
 PrivacyCG now resolved

    -   Currently we need to tell W3C when we’ll be taking our breaks,
 so we need to figure that out today

    -   Will continue to work on slides for the major topics:

        -   Charter discussion: already has its first slides – link in
     the doc

        -   Decision Tree: also needs to be fleshed out further

        -   FedCM: Will be discussed further

    -   SamG: ASking about structure or specific items?

    -   Heather:

        -   Both

        -   Things that need to NOT change are when we are taking our
     breaks.

        -   Apart from that, when to discuss each topic / how much time

    -   SamG:

        -   Breaks seem good

        -   Want to talk to Mozilla and others – ideally there is a slot
     in the agenda

        -   (asking BenV whether Mozilla has any opinions on agenda)

    -   BenV: Nothing specific

    -   SamG: Breaks seem good to go now, so if we can adjust slots and
 potentially add time for discussion with Mozilla that would be
 good

-   FedCM

    -   Timing Attack Issue, in particular (Issue 230)

    -   (SamG commenting)

    -   Big recent change: Privacy Sandbox 3P cookie depreciation pushed
 out by \~1 year (Q3 2024) -
 [<u>https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en\_us/open-web/\#the-privacy-sandbox-timeline</u>](https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/open-web/#the-privacy-sandbox-timeline)

    -   Timelines important / matter a lot, so we should discuss this

    -   How we should go about our planning, given the “extra” time

    -   General Availability (available in Chrome Stable) available in
 Q3 2023

    -   Lots of iteration expected between now and then

    -   Generally good news for FedCM - somewhat more time to accomplish
 things we were planning on getting done

    -   So… how to prioritize what we want to do

    -   TAG reviewers have also come out with a generally positive
 review of FedCM

        -   (TAG is group of people to review new / modified APIs for
     the Web)

        -   [<u>https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/718</u>](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/718)

    -   Mozilla also published their position on FedCM

        -   Also generally supportive - lots of good feedback on
     challenges ahead

        -   BenV and Martin Thomson have provided a lot of good feedback

    -   TWo non-trivial issues being worked on

        -   Multi-IDP Account Chooser

            -   Have been wanting to do for a long time

            -   Existing implemetnation was One IDP only

            -   Currently being implemented / prototyped

        -   Privacy Timing Attack (found by Mozilla)

            -   Curtrently exploring the trade-offs involved in
         resolving that attack

            -   No silver bullet solution yet

            -   Trade-off between (degree of) privacy and ergonomics

        -   As a result we have extended our I2S by 2 milestones to
     Chrome M108 (from M106)

        -   Extending the Origin Trial through M106 and M017

        -   Fine to extend Origin Trial currently, but Origin Trial
     system is not designed to be extended indefinitely

        -   Expecting lots of good discussion at TPAC with

            -   Rick Byers (Google Chrome)

            -   Mozilla folks (BenV / Martin Thomson)

            -   WebKit folks (John Wilander?)

            -   Microsoft folks

            -   Many others

        -   M108 puts us after TPAC, allowing \~1 month to make changes
     after TPAC before M108 branch point (Oct, 2022; Release to
     stable in Nov 2022)

        -   Slide show / GitHub discussion exists illustrating the
     timing attack

-   Kris: Question for Ben

    -   Noticed in Martin’s Post - a couple of issues raised against
 FedCM

    -   Is Timing Attack the only blocker or are there any?

-   BenV: Having the Multi-IDP Account Chooser is also important too

    -   Refer to Mozilla’s official standards position for the best
 perspective

    -   Mozilla's standard position:
 [<u>https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/618\#issuecomment-1221964677</u>](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/618#issuecomment-1221964677)

-   SamG: Started building prototype of Multi-IDP to start exploring that

    -   Already finding lots of corner-cases in the UX involved

    -   Should probably discuss that here

    -   Achim also seems to be involved

-   Achim:

    -   Had a call on the cascaded federated scenarios

    -   Usually deal with Multiple IDPs that may or may not be proxied

    -   Also tickets raised - even though heavy lifting is being done
 between Browsers and IDPS, still have to talk with RPs on how
 they call these APIs, especially in the Multi-IDP scenarios

    -   STarting discussions on that with some big RPs

    -   Need to explore this to discover effects on the usage of FedCM

    -   For the Cascading Federated also have related discussions on
 GitHub

    -   Discussing with Brian on cases where the system may need user
 interactions at regular points for, eg., re-authentication

    -   Similarity with Web Payments space, which has similar needs to
 periodically authenticate / re-authenticate users via user
 interaction

-   BenV:

    -   Mozilla has started prototyping FedCM(!!!)

-   SamG:

    -   Very grateful for Mozilla’s attention to this:

        -   Publishing positions

        -   Issues on FedCM

        -   Starting prototyping

        -   Finding bugs

        -   Etc.

    -   This attention was a major signal in Chrome delaying I2S until
 M108

-   Heather:

    -   What type of feedback would be most valuable at this point?

-   SamG:

    -   No clear answer

    -   Already have numerous problems

    -   Having Mozilla especially, has been hugely valuable

    -   Having other Browsers (esp. Safari – Tess and John Wilander)
 would be very valuable as well

    -   Multi-IDP

        -   Cannot be solved by Browser vendors alone

        -   Need others (IDPS, RPs, representation from users) will be
     key

    -   Front-Channel Logout

        -   We don’t yet have a solid comprehensive solution

        -   Need feedback on that

    -   Timing Attack problem

        -   Chrome is trying to represent IDPs for this problem

        -   But would be very useful for other IDPs to weigh in

        -   Nothing black-or-white

        -   Will need to be a balance between different trade-offs

        -   So if the Fed ID CG could evaluate those trade-offs and come

-   BrianD:

    -   Lots of the guidance talk about lowering the friction for users

    -   Very difficult when dealing with Accounts Choosers

    -   Absent currently is input from RPs that would like to deal with
 multiple IDPs

    -   Need one or more key RPs who would be willing to engage with us
 on this feature - will be key to success

-   SamG:

    -   Other topic: Same-Party Federation

    -   Overloaded term - doesn’t meant the same for everyone

    -   Would like to have a TPAC discussion over whether FedCM should
 also cover the First-Party Federation or whether those
 use-cases were being covered via First Party Sets or other
 type of mechanism:

        -   Logging into Instagram with FaceBook account

        -   Logging into YouTube with Google account

        -   Logging into Audible with Amazon account

        -   Etc.

-   BenV:

    -   (can’t remember specific areas where FedCM doesn’t work)

    -   But in general it would be good if FedCM \*did\* cover those
 cases too

    -   First Party Sets support in Mozilla is further back in the
 standards

-   SamG:

    -   Johann is also on the call – major support for FPS

    -   FPS solves very well the multiple country codes issues
 (google.com / google.ca / google.co.uk / etc.)

-   Johann:

    -   Are you imagining the same type of User Flow that is present in
 FeDCM?

    -   If so, that might work

    -   If we’re talking about FB / Instagram

    -   Could imagine a flow where they log in with FB

    -   But could also imagine other organizations that might be in
 First Party, but could end up being confusing to users if we
 had the First Party Federated (automated) login

-   BenV:

    -   Those types of carve-oputs might be a bit unwise for those cases

    -   Carve-outs shjould be along the lines of the existing API

    -   Which is requestStorageACccess() at the moment

-   Johann:

    -   We’ve also stated that we are more supportive of some sort of
 mediation based API than more generic like rSA-4 / SAA

    -   If the stance is to use rSA/SAA for seamless login across first
 party sets, the idea would be ideally get away from that type
 of seamless login over time (maybe allow rSA / SAA for a
 couple of years with possibly a different UI treatment than
 FedCM)

-   BenV:

    -   Like that better than using rSA / SAA

    -   If that is needed as an absolute requirement, we should discuss
 that

    -   Mozilla doesn’t particularly like First Party sets

        -   Currently evaluating the most recent First Party sets
     proposal

-   Kris:

    -   Salesforce definitely in this boat (multiple first party
 domains)

    -   FPS will not be used – doesn’t suit all Salesforce’s needs

    -   rSA has generally been a nightmare to get going

    -   Would MUCH rather require FedCM that does not involve FPS

-   SamG:

    -   Clear we won’t be able to resolve this here – was hoping TPAC
 discussion would be a better discussion

    -   Would like to see if we could have

-   BenV:

    -   Not sure if he’ll be there for Wed - but will be there for Mon /
 Tue

-   SamG: Will try to schedule jsomething for Mon / Tue

    -   Will work with Heather and Tim to get Browser representation

    -   And Johann to get FPS representation

    -   Breakout sessions seem good - FedIDCG / PrivacyCG / WICG

-   Heather:

    -   Need to report back our findings to the W3C(?)

-   Johann:

    -   Ok to say you don’t want to consider FPS

    -   But what specifically breaks the deal for you?

    -   Last call: JS requirement for rSA seemed to be problematic

    -   But that will also exist with FeDCM

    -   Also the list and associated list limit

-   Kris

    -   Yes JS is an issue due to email (mostly)

    -   When FPS came up originally - seemed like a great idea

    -   However Ssalesforce has \~400 domains

    -   And domains that would be in any particular set is dynamic

    -   Dep\[ends on what things each customer RP bought

    -   So, it’s very different – not like fixed FPS like countries

    -   Also, what is actually in an FPS si in question

        -   Privacy Policies are specific to each product

        -   So sharing Privacy Policies across FPSs would actually
     \*lose\* protection and legal would likely not be happy
     with that

-   Johann:

    -   If we want privileged treatment for a First Party, need to base
 that on something

    -   The list is always complicated

    -   If RPs want better treatment for First Parties, how do you
 establish what those are?

-   Heather:

    -   Kris uploaded a bunch fo updates to tree diagrams

-   Kris:

    -   [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/main/decision\_tree\_flows/login/Federated%2520Login%2520OIDC%2520Oauth2%2520Auth%2520Code%2520Flow.png](https://us02st-cf.zoom.us/web_client/6orpgrb/html/externalLinkPage.html?ref=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/main/decision_tree_flows/login/Federated%252520Login%252520OIDC%252520Oauth2%252520Auth%252520Code%252520Flow.png)

    -   OIDC / OAuthn 2.0 Authorization flow

    -   At the top where user is logging in

    -   At the left – is there an active session cookie?

    -   If you go down the “No” path

    -   Is it being tracked on server side?

    -   George last call said that we’d still need a client-side cookie
 to associate witht he server side session

    -   Changed it to accommodate that

    -   Also: One cookie could be session cookie, not associated with a
 user

    -   However, if it is being tracked server side, it often is
 associated with a user

    -   Anyone have any opinions on that?

    -   Submit issues on Slack if you do

    -   Continuing down login flow

    -   There is IDP Selection

    -   Nothing much yet but starting to add that to this flow to

    -   \#2 breakout

    -   Very simple - is it using 1P cookie? If not it’s a 3P cookie and
 whether Chrome or not?

    -   Will change that to be not Chrome-specific

-   Heather

    -   These diagrams are super useful to see “how would I even use
 FedCM?”

    -   But also developers are looking for instructions

    -   So answer to question is dependent on how people want to use
 this

-   Kris:

    -   Probably more about decisions than instructions

    -   If we’ve added in all possibilities of using 3P cookie and we
 could use CHIPs, FPS / etc. then picker tries to make it more
 restrictive, that might not be that helpful

    -   Should we instead continue to show all the potential options of
 ways to choose the 3P cookie (thinking that we should continue
 to keep it as open as possible – keep representing all the
 different ways for now at least)

    -   Also, even though people want specific instructions on how to
 use it, it’s hard to provide that info without knowing about
 specifics of each RPs situation

    -   Also thinking about this from the perspective of RP developers
 who might not be as familiar with these specific issues
 compared to, say, IDP developers.

-   Heather

    -   Always looking at this from the perspective of the User’s
 journey

    -   What path does the user have to take to do their login thing

    -   Every time we talk about IDP selection, cannot help to think
 about this thing that we have to deal with every day.

    -   In aggregate, there are &gt;5,000 IDPs to choose from

        -   (in login.geant.org/)

-   Kris:

    -   Other thing to think about: CNAMEs

    -   Generic across all browsers

    -   Safari / Brave / Mozilla (maybe) working on CNAME blocking

    -   Do we want to flag that CNAMEs will therefore potentially

-   BenV:

    -   Note that Mozilla has chosen NOT to do any defenses against
 CNAMEs

    -   Apple originally went after it because trackers used CNAMEs to
 avoid tracking mitigation

    -   Trying to block CNAMEs ends up in a cat-and-mouse game that does
 not benefit users

-   Heather:

    -   Next week is Pacific TimeZone call

    -   Call after that will be canceled (US Labor Day)

    -   Call after \*that\* will be also canceled (TPAC)
