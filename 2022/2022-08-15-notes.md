Notes
=====

-   TPAC:

    -   Heather: Conflicts between the different CG Groups, w3c trying
 to pull those apart best we can. Right now deconflicted with
 PrivacyCG. Still getting everyone's approval/acceptance (but
 everything is still mon/tues)

-   Chrome Decision Tree Flows

    -   Heather: Peter added a PR for the chrome decision tree flows (1
 for login, 1 for logout)

    -   Peter KH: start with login flow. Very similar to what kris had,
 only difference is adding a lot of “Early outs”. Using CNAME,
 redirect pop-ups, authenticated embed, and otherways to login
 prior to relying on FedCM. There’s a diagram below for the
 login flow (maybe start with login piece) that describes
 certain conditions because not affected by 3r party cookie
 depreciation. If need front channel logout can use FedCM, but
 if redirect/pop-up based login work and don’t need
 authenticated widgets (3rd party authed) then don’t need
 FedCM. In case where not using pop-up or redirect, the flows
 not publicly controversial, the social widget has set of
 things asked (based on level of consent needed), the IDP sdk
 will be called and user grants consent. If user need
 additional consent (maybe based on geography), additional
 consent collected via pop-up/re-direct. At the bottom of the
 branch, the ID token endpoint return s token and other
 information. Since request contains cookie, server can
 echo/return that information. Will limit size of information
 provided by IDP in ID token. In the second diagram (flow for
 needing auth from authenticated embeds or FedId Login), if
 it’s in top level frame or 3rd party set. Currently have
 solution for enterprise login, but no solution for Bring you
 Own device. If you need more than what FedCM prompt provides,
 then need to use pop-up or redirect to collect consent. At the
 bottom you can see what kind of token the IDP expects/needs.

    -   Heather: when you say :more uncertain, what does that mean?

    -   Peter: could mean, uncertain about pieces and most likely to
 change. More confidence in social widgets rather than other
 parts of diagram.

    -   Vittorio: Looks like diagram is missing what are we doing from
 id perspective. Like is there a ID token we may never see at
 the user agent? May be some cases best to have upfront (like
 login, or auth code flow). Or doing code flow from an SPA, or
 doing it from javascript. Or ID token for reliant party and no
 JS SDK. I understand what’s important from SDK X but that’s
 probably the highest order bit (not assuming people building
 this from scratch) (wouldn’t use random artifact/library.

    -   Peter: noticed auth code and implicit flow in diagram not very
 useful up front. If someone wanted authcode flow go to right
 side of diagram. Would appreciate if all comments in github
 issue.

    -   Heather: let’s switch over to [<u>logout
 page</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/blob/main/decision_tree_flows/Draft%20Chrome%20Federated%20Logout.png)

    -   Kris: all I did was add a block to describe if it’s enterprise
 managed and what parties are it applied to.

    -   Vittorio: there is no “not through the user agent”, there is
 logout and logout clean up. If I am relying on another party
 then logout is always through first party. And where you get
 front/back channel comes from cleanup. If I want to spread my
 logout then I tell IDP I need to close this session, and tell
 RDP I want to be contacted through front/back channel. If i
 get channel when I need to logout (front/back both good). It’s
 actually the IDP that needs special measure to logout.

    -   Peter: so you are saying this flow should be limited to logout
 clean up

    -   Vittorio: actually 2 diagrams, one for cleanup and one for
 “spreading the logout”. May have situations where IDP embedded
 in RP that need to be referenced elsewhere so that some
 constraints of one apply to other. Also for enterprise policy
 setup, we can save that until we get 2 different diagrams.
