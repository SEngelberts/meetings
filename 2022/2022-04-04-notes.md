Notes
=====

-   Pete - It’s still in early days for browsers.

-   Heather - Questions or concerns??

-   Vittorio - How would you rate breaking existing critical
  infrastructure?

-   Pete - We are breaking stuff, some intentionally, some
  unintentionally. At Brave, we are aware of the risks. Some things
  are intended to break.

-   Cameron - How do you handle debouncing?

    -   Strip Link decoration

    -   If they have a mapping Brave will fast forward the user to the
  destination

    -   If not they will warn the user they are about to enter a path
  with a bounce tracker

    -   If the path it taken it is in a partitioned container to
  minimize exposure

-   Pete - There are 3 mitigations:

    -   Crosssite projects (?)

    -   Measurement of the web

    -   Direct reports from the people

    -   Ultimate destination

    -   https://privacytests.org

-   Ben - List based things, we keep it outside of the core platform.
  More protection for our users. Do you see navigational protections
  core to the platform or browser feature?

-   Pete - We would like to push these protections to broader adoption.
  Maybe under the W3C logo. We are more interested in the platform
  level conversations for the solution.

-   Cameron - Brave is doing something unique to Brave. Is there such a
  thing like using cloud for protection ?

-   Pete - No chance to gather user data for user identification.

    -   We collect URLs for the use cases when the shield is lowered.

-   Heather - SAML has not changed. There are not too many ppl working
  on it (not using, I meant working on it).

-   Pete - Definitely, not

-   Heather - Are you getting help?

-   Pete - Still early days for the definitions. We don’t have anything
  finalized for what is going to be broken, or not.

-   Heather - We have a table for 3pc, link decoration, bounce tracking.
  There is a second table for mitigations.

-   Pete - We can be helpful for that.
