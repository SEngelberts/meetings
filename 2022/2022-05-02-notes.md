Notes
=====

-   Observations re: IIW and BlinkOn and conferences in general

    -   Identity people tend to go to Identity people, whereas
  Browser-focused people tend to go to Browser-focused
  conferences

    -   So…to promote cross-pollination, request for Identity-focused
  people to also register for and attend BlinkOn (link above)

-   Re: TPAC and FedID meetings around then

    -   Ideally time things for maximal cross-over between Identity
  folks and TPAC / Web-focused people

-   IIW (last week)

    -   Three sessions of interest to our things

        -   General Intro - how can browsers identify browser-specific
      flows (no notes)

        -   Day 2 - Session 1: Backchannel logout and shared signals for
      events

            -   How can those help when 3P Cookies go away and
          additional changes for unintended tracking happen

            -   Notes: [<u>Backchannel Logout and Shared Signals and
          Events</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOOhJFAFyKefPUo0Tie0-B18dCLA6cz-ttK5T0G0p8M/edit)

        -   Day 3 - What are relationships between WebAuthn / WebOTP /
      FedID

            -   Notes: [<u>Webauthn, WebOTP, FedCM, Password Managers -
          Relationships?</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DzUCOmrcnOJtKuO61tILO2NVBGnNBXYPvpDXNv3vow/edit)

    -   Backchannel logout session

        -   Tim:

            -   Additional clarity was that potential solutions do not
          necessarily ean reality

            -   SSE is a lot more flexible than just backchannel logout

            -   SSE is a framework for sharing events

            -   Order of options in increasing complexity

                -   Do nothing

                -   Implement FedCM

                -   Implement backchannel logout

                -   Implement SSE

        -   Vittorio:

            -   Technical solutions exist to keep logout functional but
          it will be a long journey for most people

            -   Need to look at how FedCM works for a number of
          scenarios

            -   For example, cascading federation bounces does not seem
          to be handled well

        -   Tim:

            -   Topic: Asking folks to implement FedCM for just logout –
          probably FedCM needs additional benefits beyond just
          taht

            -   For example - could the Browser be responsible for
          logout regardless of whether the user is actually on
          the page

            -   Ie., only the IDP has to do anything, even if the user
          closes the RP’s page, the Browser reaches out to the
          affected RPs to log the user out (eg., in the
          background)

            -   And if the IDP could then get a feedback that the
          browser has logged the user out from all the affected
          RPs

        -   Heather:

            -   Both major protocols (SAML and OIDC) both need that for
          logout (after 3P cookie deprecation)

            -   Also - group called DASI (EU research group) would be a
          great test group to test these things out

            -   Also: Backchannel logout - in enterprise scenario where
          there’s a split between on-prem and cloud, backchannel
          logout doesn’t really work at all

                -   (which is a very common scenario)

        -   Tim:

            -   Applications that are behind a firewall are the most
          sensitive and can’t be touched / affected

        -   Vittorio:

            -   For backchannel log0out, logout signal goes from IDP to
          server, server-to-server

            -   Otherwise it would normally go through the browser

            -   If there is something entirely behind firewall, then
          server-to-server needs an endpoint exposed (on the
          outside internet)

            -   That’s easier for public / cloud

            -   Harder for on-prem - need something like DMZs to expose
          those endpoints securely

            -   Ie., internal endpoints might need additional infra
          config to support these scenarios

        -   Kris:

            -   Although these are workable solutions, the feeling is
          that these increase security risks, so they are in
          general typically not implemented for that reason.

        -   Heather:

            -   RFC8935 / 8936 are relevant here

    -   Session 2 on Day 2

        -   WebAuthn / WebOTP / FedID / etc. convergence / similarity

        -   Tim:

            -   By the time we got to the end – had a picture of the
          relationship moving forward in a future converged
          world

            -   WebAuthn - thinking about credentials and how they work

            -   Distinction between accounts and credentials are super
          important

            -   But is still a confusing topic

            -   Esp in the context of selecting accounts vs. credentials

            -   Eg., Cannot use Google credential in Microsoft’s world

            -   The way we think they will work together

            -   May use a wallet to create an account

            -   Get a list of claims

            -   Eg., you have a wallet that can (assert/?) that this is
          a verified email

            -   In the future you would create a WebAuthn credential and
          then you would use the WebAuthn credential for
          authentication from that point on.

            -   And you wouldn’t need to use the verified email from
          that point on

            -   Only would need to use the WebAuthn credential to
          validate any new claims you want to assert

            -   Envision a future where you could register some claims
          AND create/register a WebAuthn credential at the same
          time

        -   Sam:

            -   Re: strongly origin-bound constraint for registrations

            -   How much do people care that you get origin binding for
          WebAuthn

        -   Tim:

            -   It is the password replacement

        -   SamW:

            -   SPC, from the Web Payments WG, is looking to register a
          WebAuthn credential that can be used cross-origin for
          payments

        -   George:

            -   They are predicated on the fact the RP already has the
          appropriate credential ID

        -   SamW:

            -   The Web Payments WP is having meetings this
          Tues/Wed/Thurs; Wednesday they are currently talking
          about the privacy issues around that.

        -   Sam Goto:

            -   That session was happening adjacent to numerous groups

            -   Currently work closely with Dirk and Ken and Adam on the
          WebAuthn

            -   Seem to be directionally aligned

            -   Will have to wait and see how PassKeys go – expectding
          they will improve and ultimately be the way to do
          WebAuthn

            -   And likely that PassKeys will be preferred method over
          FedID for Account

            -   Thinking taht long-term - FedCM would be one thing that
          you would call rarely to create accounts or recover
          accounts

            -   But from that point on mostly would use WebAuthn /
          PassKeys for most logins / authentication

            -   But also: concept of Wallets is not clear

            -   Will have to disentangle thing

            -   Waht is the relationship between Federation and Wallets

            -   Federation / MDL / VCs

            -   Saw the first time on how VCs could be passed through
          (via OIDC?)

            -   Is a wallet a way to server up MDLs / VCs from
          self-issued identity providers?

            -   Should that discussion be pushed more towards WebAuthn?
          Or FedCM? Or something else?

            -   Had good session with Tobias and Wayne (and someone
          else) on this topic

        -   Tim:

            -   We do have clear lines between

                -   Wallets

                -   Authentication

                -   Credential Handler

            -   We have known APIs for two of these (WebAuthn and FedCM)

            -   FIDO Alliance group in discussions to create a new WG

        -   SamG:

            -   Lots of related discussions

            -   Should we expose VCs and MDLs through FedCM?

        -   Tim:

            -   We should probably discuss that in this CG

            -   But might need to re-charter this CG to discuss this

        -   Heather:

            -   We did intentionally put out the wallet discussions from
          this CG to be able to focus on 3P cookie issue

            -   So maybe continue resolving that first?

            -   What does it mean for a federation operator, should teh
          world move to having wallets, etc. and most Federation
          operators don’t even know what that means

        -   Tim:

            -   At the end of the day, greeting a claim from a Wallet is
          NOT federation

        -   Vittorio:

            -   Wallets in the sense of decentralization don’t really
          exist yet

            -   Original charter for our CG is to preserver what already
          exists

            -   Wallets might be a place that people go to, to mitigate
          potential deficiencies in Federation (wrt to these new
          technologies)

        -   SamG:

            -   Agree that 3P cookie deprecation is urgent and we have
          to deal with that with priority

            -   But…we also need a place to be able to have discussions
          about future convergence3 as well

            -   Re; wallets: Not well-defined

            -   None of us have shared understanding of what a wallet is

            -   In EDU, Able to share your university diplomas with
          websites, assuming today is done with OAuth and OIDC,
          starts to find a lot of intersection with wallets on
          alternate ways to do this type of sharing

        -   Tim:

            -   Not sure that people are actually using OAuth or OIDC to
          share university credentials (yet)

            -   Verifiable credentials is an assertion format does not
          require any other decentralized tech to work

            -   Wallet is a container of credentials that could be on
          any device (on cloud, on a particular device, etc.)

            -   This group was never chartered to address these types of
          broader issues

            -   So, not sure that this i the right forum

        -   Achim

            -   Agree with Tim and Vittorio that cross-device /
          unification of WebAuthn / FedID / others is a very
          interesting conversation so we should try to find a
          way to discuss those (in some CG)

            -   Also, cascading issues are more important than future
          wallet issue, so those should have priority over
          wallets

-   Heather:

    -   Origin Trial for FedCM has begun (Android only for now)

    -   DevRel team documentation is now available

    -   Has been posted on Slack and Twitter

-   SamG:

    -   M103 will have Desktop (Releases in June)
  [<u>https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fedcm-origin-trial/</u>](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fedcm-origin-trial/)

    -   [<u>https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/fedcm/</u>](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/fedcm/)

    -   Now in Chrome Canary for people who want to try it out

    -   Much easier to develop / test FedCM on desktop than on the phone

    -   Functionality is constantly improving as the team continues to
  work on it

-   Heather:

    -   Next week’s called is APAC timeframe

    -   Will likely be working on the Draft Report during that session

    -   Heather and Tim will be in Berlin that day

        -   (European Identity Cloud Conference - FinTech and Enterprise
      focused)

        -   All of EU will need MDLs, so will be interesting to see how
      it all plays out in the near term

    -   So, Kris will run the meeting

    -   Next Atlantic call will be on May 16th
