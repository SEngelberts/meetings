Notes
=====

-   Agenda: Blog Post and Draft Report and

-   Draft report

    -   Introduction needs to be it’s own blog post, Heather will post
  this by the end of the month

    -   WIll continue to work on draft report, it is not quite ready
  this month

    -   Blog post comments:

        -   Brian May - SSO for accessing a single company’s resources,
      this is being widely used and could be used to affiliate
      with multiple sites / company

        -   Kristen Chapman - this could or should be added as a new
      term to be defined and can be used this way, this could be
      named something different from SSO to clarify

        -   Brian May - “bad actors” this is a sensitive term, and cross
      site tracking has multiple legitimate uses and is not bad
      actors, we should strip out the “bad actors”
      term/reference and just state that “this is being done”

        -   Brian cont. - in last sentence “federated … without debating
      **IT**” change IT to “third party cookies”

        -   Kristen Chapman - on “bad actors” intention was for this to
      refer to bad actors as cross site tracking **WITH** the
      bad action against users wills, should add language to
      imply “not consent and full understanding” and remove “bad
      actors”

        -   Ben VanderSloot - remove hypothetical “could” from bad
      actors language

        -   Vittorio - will add more comments to the document, would be
      useful to have an agreement on what we are trying to
      achieve, right now this is selling the advantage and
      hinting that it is a clear threat. There isn’t a clear
      trajectory and value statement, need ot defne **1 short
      sentence about what we are trying to achieve** would be
      easier to shape the blog post this way

        -   Kristen - original point of the blog was to define why are
      we talking about this but also providing and introduction
      for people that are new to the space, will add in the
      point as suggested by Vittorio

        -   Brian May - elaborate on sanctioned tracking ina future blog
      post

        -   Kristen - problem with focus on deprecation of third party
      cookies is there is more happening underway in the browser
      when there are other changes like navigational tracking
      changes

        -   George Fletcher - concern is that this could be all over the
      place, focusing on other things that cannot be solved in
      the browser, focusing on specific thing could be a benefit
      if time is important

        -   Noreen from chat: Would be good to link out to documents
      that support some of the statements we are making, like
      why we say cookies are going away, and images of some of
      the interfaces described, like university/SSO logins.

        -   Kristen - state that this will focus on 3rd party cookie
      changes but will also state that there are broader things
      going on also

        -   Vittorio - be more focused about the goal of the document,
      what do we assume the reader already knows. Agree that
      getting into the weeds of tracking is not a good fit for
      introductory document.

        -   Brian May - can do a call to discuss this more offline

        -   Heather - getting blogpost out this week is not ready, will
      focus on getting it ready for next Wednesday

            -   3rd party cookies have been important because this is an
          existing known challenge

            -   A lot of people are waiting for the link decoration
          discussion because this going to get messy

            -   Pre-reading in the github agenda points to the proposal

            -   Pete from Brave is joining for 30 minutes to discuss the
          proposal, for homework read the proposal in prep for
          this cross group discussion

            -   Brian May - bounce tracking is also being actively
          pursued by mozilla and firefox

            -   Kristen - Brave is implementing bounce tracking by
          stripping URL parameters by “list” Safari’s version of
          this solution is not as clear and is not known the way
          other browsers are

            -   George - safari is looking at silent redirects between 2
          sites and if you get more than 10 of those to a
          specific site, that site gets flagged as bounce
          tracker and changes all of the cookies for that
          domain. This is a completely different method

            -   Kristen - also navigation tracking is being done in a
          different way

            -   Brian - safari approach is problematic because its
          specific to the browser “stop using safari” to fix a
          problem
