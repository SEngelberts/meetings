[Draft Community Group Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-UbhD7_d_X8h1_aEFV-nrlkMf2pQDTuf_s70ycYj20/edit)
-

-   what needs to be in a community group report? Need to make sure we
       cover: For the use cases we have, which are accepted\|complete?
       What has the community group signed off on? We also need to
       consider how to tag that clearly in GitHub.

-   (Vittorio) Have lost track a bit on exactly what we’re working on.
       Are we agreed we’re working on 3p cookies? If yes, then we can
       consider whether the work item actually solves for that problem.

-   (Dan) speaking for FedCM, that’s useful feedback. Trying to make
       sure that the FedCM spec meets the community groups needs. I am
       still new to identity, so recognize I’m getting a lot wrong. Want
       to make sure we haven’t boxed ourself in when we’re dealing with
       3p cookies such that FedCM will still work for link decoration.

-   (Vittorio) it’s always good to be future proof, but going too far
       there may mean that we also need to talk about all the other
       things we’re solving for. Originally we were focused only on 3p
       cookies, but if the design is for more, we have to discuss more.
       We are back to the analogy of rebuilding the entire car, rather
       than just fixing the radio. Would rather we do evolution not
       revolution; the future proofing, if it ends up requiring protocol
       changes, is going to hit the SAML wall, and that’s not going to be
       effective.

-   (Dan) what do you mean by “preserve” - that the browser gives you a
       cookie you can do what you want with, that you can do the same
       authN you do now regardless of what you do to get it?

-   (Vittorio) I don’t know what I mean in practice. That is part of
       what we should do in this group. We know when people sign out from
       one RP that they assume all other RP they have a sesion with in
       that context will also sign out. We know that there is something
       that will impact how that happens today. Let’s look at what parts
       are impacted, and compare it to the reality of what’s out there?
       Are the flows mostly driven by the server side? Sam has the
       hypothesis that most people use Javascript SDKs, but that’s not
       true. What does that mean? We need to have a new property in
       cookies. But is that viable? Or are there other options? If we pop
       out a dialogue, will that work instead? Or, is there for a
       specific population where a Javascript API will work and only have
       the multiple dialogues if they don’t use that API? So, things
       would work even without the API, but the UX would be infinitely
       better if you did use it. Right now, the only alternative is the
       heaviest lift (e.g., buying a new car rather than fixing the
       radio)

-   (Dan) we’re taking into account how much effort will be required for
       different parties. Trying to get to minimal RP changes is a goal;
       if there are massive number of changes, then that’s never going to
       work. If that requires instead more changes on the part of the
       IdP…

-   (Vittorio) if I can do the work on behalf of my customers as their
       IdP operator, I would love that. But it’s not that clean a split.
       Everything is driven by redirects that runs on the RP with no
       JavaScript. So the vision of “we do this, and the IdP takes the
       brunt” that doesn’t actual fit how things work. You can’t change
       only the IdP the way FedCM suggests because the browser is just a
       mover, it does not have an active role. Doing things like caching
       the id\_token violates some of the low level assumptions of what
       id\_tokens are. The id\_token used in FedCM today is not
       compatible with how id\_tokens are defined in OIDC, but we’re not
       really focused on that because it’s not related to 3p cookies.

-   (Dan) point of clarification - we’re not caching the id\_token, but
       we are inspecting them (Dan will propose we change that, but
       hasn’t brought that up for discussion yet). When you say there is
       no JS running on the RP side, does that case use 3p cookies or
       just link decoration?

-   (Vittorio) it does for log out and sliding renewal of sessions. For
       sign out, there is no JS and that happens everywhere (RP and IdP).
       RPs will get information from the IdP that they will turn into
       cookies (and those cookies ar 3p). This isn’t necessarily a
       standard, but it is a common trick. If you have an access token
       and a refresh token, the continuous ability to use a refresh token
       is one way to verify that a session still exists. Not necessarily
       good practice, but not uncommon practice.

-   (Dan) cycling back to scope of work, is it fair to say we have
       several items, most urgent being 3p cookie deprecation?

-   (Vittorio) that’s fair, and that was an explicit scope reduction
       that came from Sam @ Google. We’re talking about two different
       time scales, one that is longer term principles, and the other is
       the short term urgent issues. If we talk about the longer term
       stuff, then you get into the conversations w just had above. But
       if you narrow it down to the urgent, then that’s something to
       think about with what we have to do today.

-   (Dan) 3p cookie is being driven by
       [<u>https://privacysandbox.com/timeline/</u>](https://privacysandbox.com/timeline/)
       . So, 3p cookie deprecation is super urgent, but link decoration
       is coming shortly after that.

-   (Kim) for the draft report, saying we’re focused on 3p cookie
       deprecation, but we need to also include what we’ll be looking at
       next. We need to include the whole problem.

-   (Vittorio) that’s fair. Am thinking about what Scott Cantor said re:
       SAML - when things start to break, SAML people will not pay
       attention. That standards effort is dormant.

-   (Kim) with the Sandbox, we need more of a timeline. If Link
       Decoration is equally short/urgent after 3p cookies, we will have
       a problem. Are we looking at 6 months, a year, more?

-   (Dan) Cannot comment on timelines. As the person who has to work on
       this for federated identity, haven’t started thinking about it
       yet. You can sort of forecast what people are thinking about with
       ITP and ITP2 and what Firefox is doing. What they’re doing is what
       Chrome will be working on.

-   (Kim) the focus on Chrome is because of the marketshare. Other orgs
       have written off Safari and just accept that things won’t work
       with that browser, so they aren’t watching ITP, etc.

-   (Vittorio) If you only look at high-end retailers and the champagne
       they include in their fitting rooms, that doens’t tell you how
       mass-market retailers need to plan for their fitting rooms.

[Terminology](https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals/wiki/Terminology)

-   (Dan) the biggest concern of terms for me is “credential” which I’m
       using as the thing inside the browser. The browser has a
       credential object, data in the browser, not anything from any of
       the auth protocols.

-   (Tim) credman artifact

-   (Vittorio) credential is a term redefined within the SSI space; in
       more traditional IAM it is much more basic. Calling tokens
       credentials is technically accurate but not very useful, but it
       will let you be confused with actual credentials. Credentials are
       raw things to gain access directly, or something you exchange for
       a token. SSI like to use credential for “verifiable credential” -
       a set of attributes that are either self-issued or come from an
       issuing authority and are tied to a mechanism to presenting those
       things.

-   (Hirsh) sign in, sign up

-   (Tim) unless an account is being created, it is not a sign up

-   (Dan) what does logout mean? and is that the same as sign out? since
       login and sign in are the same?

-   (Tim) whether signout is RP or IdP, that’s implementation specific.

-   (Vittorio) all these things need more context to ultimately define
       the term

-   (Hirsch) Edge will SSO you for other sites.

-   (Kim) Login/logout is a user action, signin/signout is a computer
       action

-   (Hirsch) what about browser extensions?

-   (Dan) Have not put any thought into that yet
