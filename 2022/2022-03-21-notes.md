Notes
=====

Discussion around ([<u>Third party cookie
mitigations</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/wiki/Third-party-cookie-mitigations))

In, draft: anyone can add to it. Do we move it to a Google doc?

**Privacy impact**: Should define what the privacy impact is: will vary
from IDP / user perspective and will add further context to discussions.

If it is moving from front-channel to back-channel doesn’t necessarily
mean it will improve privacy for the end-user.

**APIs**: still in development: need further definition. WRT first party
sets, there are limited use cases.

Need to be careful to focus on goals, vs what may or may not be
feasible.

Action: Signal on the table what specifically relates to federation: is
it designed for this purpose?

**Single-track vs multi-track focus?**

Should we focus on one area at a time e.g. front-channel log out? Would
this cause duplication later down the road? We shouldn’t be too worried
about duplication at this point, we should focus on making sure we have
all the relevant information captured. If we capture it multiple times,
we can refactor data later.

(Front-channel logout, session management, token renewal)

Session management: some people have been moving session management and
token renewal server-side, outside of the browser.

Login status API: comment that it might need to observe what happens
throughout the flow, so should stay up to date and ensure we are
aligned.
