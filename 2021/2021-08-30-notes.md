Validating the problem statement
--------------------------------

"Unsanctioned tracking of users across the web needs to be addressed and
prevented, while continuing to support user-sanctioned identity flows"

### Proposed Definition of Terms

-   Unsanctioned tracking: tracking users outside the intended use of standards-defined tracking mechanisms

-   Sanctioned tracking: tracking based upon standards \[that\] allows researchers, advocates and regulators to leverage their visibility and use tools to identify and evaluate the privacy-sensitive behavior of online tracking

### Exploring use cases

| Example                                                                                                                  | Sanctioned? | Unsanctioned? |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Collecting username during an explicit authentication flow                                                               |             |               |
| Supporting passive authentication to additional applications/websites without an explicit action on the part of the user |             |               |
| Diagnostic data for sign in (e.g., usability or protocol errors used to help troubleshoot the login process)             |             |               |
| Post-sign-in diagnostic data                                                                                             |             |               |
| Session tracking for the purposes of sign out                                                                            |             |               |
| Using identity information for anything other than authN and authZ                                                       |             |               |

### Addressing the implied problems

-   How should “sanctioned” be signaled and how can we avoid counterfeits?

-   How can the login button itself turn into a new browser primitive
 that signals the start of an identity flow to the browser such
 that the action can be considered implicitly sanctioned tracking?

Notes
=====

-   Heather:

    -   we’ll continue where we left off last time in discussion the
     problem we are trying to solve.

    -   I did reach out to the TAG reviewer and they noted that the
     document is still valid/up to date and pointed us to the same
     references that we found / noted in our reading list.

    -   We weren’t clear on what was “sanctioned” and what “wasn’t”, so
     we went over some list of use cases and tried some to see if
     we were able to classify.

    -   Do others feel like that’s a reasonable definition?

-   Sam

    -   I think that we go through we are going to learn whether that
     definition is common to us. I have an intuition that each of
     us have a different expectation in terms of what we should
     expect, specifically coming from different contexts like
     enterprise and edu.

-   Vittorio:

    -   The current definition seems a bit vague. The definition seems
     to be close to the sentiment that Sam was going over “does the
     user know?”, “does the user have a reasonable expectation of
     what was going to happen?”.

-   David Waite

    -   It seems like there are four categories

        -   Required for us

        -   Undisclosed

        -   Regulatory terms

        -   Consented sharing of information

    -   People may have an expectation that, as long as the information
     doesn’t leave that domain, etc, but I don’t know if that would
     fall into the sanctioned or non sanctioned.

-   Kristen

    -   Going back to the facebook case

    -   They are not sanctionining facebook to use that data for
     targeted ads

    -   I’m thinking of sanctioned in terms of context

-   Heather

    -   It may be useful to go over the use cases and check

    -   The first use case was the IDP collecting the IDP’s username.

-   Vittorio

    -   Is this the control case?

-   Sam

    -   Yep, that seems like a “sanctioned” use case in that yes, the
     user is aware of what’s going on here

-   Heather

    -   I think that the next case “authentication and authorization use
     case” is perhaps closer to the first one.

-   Ken

    -   Another concrete example is with social networks …

-   Brian

    -   I think that’s more complicated than that

    -   Things like phone number, email addresses, contact information

    -   Which is typically part of the sign on process

    -   Not typically authn, authz but very common information

-   Sam Goto

    -   Email addresses, do they expect that to be something that gets
     them to be tracked across RPs

-   Brian

    -   That matches more or less my intuition

-   Sam

    -   I think you have identified the the principle, which is whether
     they are being caught by surprise

-   Brian

    -   Are you thinking about conversion rates? What kinds of
     diagnostics / monitoring?

-   Tim

    -   The analogy to “we are recording your call for training
     purposes”

-   Hirsch

    -   Information that the IDP gives to the RP.

-   Brian

    -   Maybe there is an important distinction to be made between local
     vs non-local and data that is shared across domain vs not.

-   David

    -   My intuition is that some of this may be out of the charter of
     this group?

-   Heather: Session tracking may be, by implication … for the purposes
 of sign-out …

-   Vittorio: What you do with this information is the thing that
 matters … you may not be using the information, but maybe you get
 hacked …

-   Tim: Diagnostics data like geo ip … some of it is useful for the
 purposes of log out …

-   Hirsch: there is a security implication, like the user never signs
 in from a country … the IDP helps the user in making that
 determination of risk …

-   Heather: any other use case that we think is absolutely
 un-sanctioned.

-   Hirsch: signing-into apps automatically / silently seems like it
 would catch users by surprise.

-   Vittorio: yeah, any information that is exchanged without the user
 awareness …

-   Kristen: an example from salesforce …. We have a lot of domains …
 when you log into our products … we are the IDP and the RP … the
 user does not know … there are multiple domains involved here …
 dividing things into domains … but from a user perspective …. I
 don’t think that maps to the user’s interpretation.

-   Hirsch: i think that’s something that FPS gets really well.

-   Sam: that seems like forward progress. Lets write that down as a
 win.

-   Tim: is it a “legal company or entity” criteria?

-   Kristen: that goes back to the FPS definition … what I like about
 it, it is still entity based … but the criteria isn’t super clear.

-   Tim: I’d argue that under enterprise use cases you are working under
 a contract …

-   Vittorio: (tells a case about a person that worked for a hospital)

-   Vittorio: some of these things may have an expiration date.

-   Sam: lets make forward progress on the things that we agree on and
 enumerate them. I think that we’ll cover a lot of ground.

-   Heather: enumerating the things that we disagree on is also useful …
 I’m going to spend a little more time with my co-chairs … to find
 some of the absolutes. Next call is going to be europe friendly
 time …. A friday … september 17th.
