  * Reminders:

     * [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/)

* Validating the problem statement, "Unsanctioned tracking of users across the web needs to be addressed and prevented, while continuing to support user-sanctioned identity flows"
  * Proposed Definition of Terms
     * Unsanctioned tracking: tracking users outside the intended use of standards-defined tracking mechanisms
     * Sanctioned tracking: tracking based upon standards [that] allows researchers, advocates and regulators to leverage their visibility and use tools to identify and evaluate the privacy-sensitive behavior of online tracking

* Exploring use cases

| Example | Sanctioned? | Unsanctioned? |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Collecting username during an explicit authentication flow | | |
| Supporting passive authentication to additional applications/websites without an explicit action on the part of the user | | |
| Diagnostic data for sign in (e.g., usability or protocol errors used to help troubleshoot the login process) | | |
| Post-sign-in diagnostic data | | |
| Session tracking for the purposes of sign out | | |
| Using identity information for anything other than authN and authZ| | |
  
  
* Addressing the implied problems:
   * How should “sanctioned” be signaled and how can we avoid counterfeits? 
   * How can the login button itself turn into a new browser primitive that signals the start of an identity flow to the browser such that the action can be considered implicitly sanctioned tracking?
